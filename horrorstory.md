This is it. The house. The old mansion on the hill that had been the center of all sorts of chilling stories told by the neighbourhood children. Some said that it was haunted and most people who ventured in never lived to tell the tale. Others claimed that an old eccentric hermit resided in the dark basement and consumed the blood and flesh of homosapiens to stay alive. All the unsubstantiated claims had fanned the flames of my interest. Therefore, I mustered up my courage and ventured into the mansion alone, armed with a camcorder equipped with night vision.
If only I knew what I was about to encounter. If only I knew.
Other than slight slivers of moonlight streaming through the tiny cracks in the wooden window slats, I only had the illuminated screen of my camcorder to guide me around. The old wooden floorboards creaked along with each step I took, pointing my camcorder around. Graffiti adorned the walls filled with cracks and the furniture was coated with a layer of dirt, dust and cobwebs. Liquid was dripping from the ceiling and the wet floor was covered with dark puddles and shoe prints.
The night constricted around me, almost choking the life out of me. with each step I took, I could not shake the feeling that somewhere, someone-or something- was watching, waiting, for reasons unfathomable to me.
